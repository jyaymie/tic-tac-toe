MVP

Phase 1: Player-scored Version

- Build out a 3x3 grid with clickable squares
- Player1 clicks a div
    - If the div is unmarked
        - Mark the div with player1's token
        - Change the message to indicate that it's player2's turn
    - If the div is marked
        - Return nothing
- If the reset button is clicked,
    - Unmark all divs


Phase 2: Computer-scored Version
    - Add the current div (with the value set to Player 1's token) to a gameProgress object
